the clowns I have never stolen anything from anyone. If you see something similar, it means either someone actually stole from me, or it is a coincidence that it looks alike. It's also possible that we use the same work logic and code, which does not mean I have stolen anything.

another update and a new version of the r5dumperbeta.py script (final versions script) 

You can now develop the script further yourself if you wish. The GNU General Public License v3.0 allows you to do so, but don't expect any more support from me. I've had enough. I thought I'd finish at version 4, but I decided to create version 5 beta (this is the final one, there won't be any more, as I said for now).

This script was created for educational purposes only. Users are solely responsible for how they use it. We respect developers and urge them to fix vulnerabilities. Our goal is not to cause harm, but to promote fair and secure gameplay!
