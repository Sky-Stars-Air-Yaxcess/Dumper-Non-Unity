another update and a new version of the r5dumperbeta.py script (final versions script) 

You can now develop the script further yourself if you wish. The GNU General Public License v3.0 allows you to do so, but don't expect any more support from me. I've had enough. I thought I'd finish at version 4, but I decided to create version 5 beta (this is the final one, there won't be any more, as I said for now).

This script was created for educational purposes only. Users are solely responsible for how they use it. We respect developers and urge them to fix vulnerabilities. Our goal is not to cause harm, but to promote fair and secure gameplay!

First time installation setup commands!

root users:

su (super users root)

chmod 777 r2dump2.py or r3dumper.py (permission)

termux-setup-storage

pkg update && pkg upgrade -y

pkg install build-essential git binutils -y

pkg install radare2

pkg install python3

pip install tqdm

rootless users:

termux-setup-storage

pkg update && pkg upgrade -y

pkg install build-essential git binutils -y

pkg install radare2

pkg install python3

pip install tqdm

Now You are ready to use Radare2!

Now Every time you need to dump a unreal engine lib just follow 2 commend below mentioned.
